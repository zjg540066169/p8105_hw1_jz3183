# Homework 1 for Data Science Course p8105

This is an R Markdown document for homework 1 in course p8105. The author is Jungang Zou whose UNI is jz3183.

## Problem 1

```{r df_p1_create, collapse = TRUE}
# create the data frame
df_p1 <- tibble(
  random_sample = rnorm(8),
  logical_vector = random_sample > 0,
  character_vector = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h"),
  factor_vector = factor(c("class_1","class_3","class_2","class_1","class_2","class_3","class_1","class_2"), 
                         levels = c("class_1","class_2","class_3"))
)

# display the data frame
df_p1
```

Calculate the mean of each variable in dataframe df_p1. The results are as follows:

* The mean of random_sample is `r mean(pull(df_p1, random_sample))`. 
* The mean of logical_vector is `r mean(pull(df_p1, logical_vector))`. 
* The mean of character_vector is `r mean(pull(df_p1, character_vector))`. 
* The mean of factor_vector is `r mean(pull(df_p1, factor_vector))`. 

The reason why the mean of character_vector and factor_vector is NA, is that the function of mean can not be applied to the data whose type is character vector or factor vector.


The next code chunk is to test the as.number() function and some explanation will be used to explain the results.

```{r as_numeric_function, results = 'hide', collapse = TRUE}
as.numeric(pull(df_p1, random_sample))    # convert numeric to numeric
as.numeric(pull(df_p1, logical_vector))   # convert logical to numeric
as.numeric(pull(df_p1, character_vector)) # convert character to numeric
as.numeric(pull(df_p1, factor_vector))    # convert factor to numeric
```

Actually, the function as.number is used to convert other data type to double float number. 

* For numeric data, it keeps the same data type.
* For logical data, it converts TRUE to 1, and FALSE to 0. 
* For character data, it doesn`t work.
* For factor data, it converts the factor to number referring to factor levels. This process makes the factor data meaningless.

Since the function of mean() whose parameter only can be numeric or logical, so it can not be applied to other type of data.


The next code chunk is to test different convertion among logical vector and different data types.

```{r as_numeric_function_multiplication, collapse = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
as.numeric(pull(df_p1, logical_vector)) * pull(df_p1, random_sample)            # convert numeric to numeric and multiplication

as.factor(pull(df_p1, logical_vector)) * pull(df_p1, random_sample)             # convert logical to numeric and multiplication

as.numeric(as.factor(pull(df_p1, logical_vector))) * pull(df_p1, random_sample) # convert factor to numeric and multiplication
```

As we can see, multiplication is not meaningful for factor.


## Problem 2

```{r setup_2, include = FALSE} 
# To clean up the memories and variables to avoid some problems.
rm(list = ls())
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library("tidyverse")
set.seed(2)
```


```{r df_p2_create, collapse = TRUE}
# create the data frame
df_p2 <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(500),
  y = rnorm(500),
  logical_vector = (x + y) > 1,
  numeric_vector = as.numeric(logical_vector),
  factor_vector = as.factor(logical_vector)
)

# display the data frame
df_p2
```

There is a short description for these vectors:

* the size of the dataset is (`r nrow(df_p2)`, `r ncol(df_p2)`).
* the mean of x is `r mean(pull(df_p2,x))`, median of x is `r median(pull(df_p2,x))`, and standard deviation of x is `r sd(pull(df_p2,x))`.
* the proportion of cases for which x + y > 1 is `r sum(pull(df_p2, logical_vector)) / length(pull(df_p2, logical_vector))`.


The next code chunk is used to plot some graphs by ggplot

```{r df_p2_plot, collapse = TRUE}
# scatterplot of y vs x group by logical vector
first_graph <- ggplot(df_p2, aes(x = x, y = y, color = logical_vector)) + geom_point() + labs(title = "Scatterplot of y vs x group by logical vector", x = "x", y = "y") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
first_graph

# scatterplot of y vs x group by numeric vector
second_graph <- ggplot(df_p2, aes(x = x, y = y, color = numeric_vector)) + geom_point() + labs(title = "Scatterplot of y vs x group by numeric vector", x = "x", y = "y") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
second_graph

# scatterplot of y vs x group by factor vector
third_graph <- ggplot(df_p2, aes(x = x, y = y, color = factor_vector)) + geom_point() + labs(title = "Scatterplot of y vs x group by factor vector", x = "x", y = "y") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
third_graph
```

As we know, since x and y are all from stardard normal distribution, so the mean of x is 0 and the mean of y is 0. From this, the mean of x + y is also 0, so the number of x + y <= 1 is greater than x + y > 1. This is the reason why the number of FALSE point is greater than the number of TRUE points in the first scatterplot.

As for the second and third scatterplots, the same reasons hold. So in the second scatterplot, the number of 0 point is greater than the number of 1 point. And in the third scatterplot, the number of FALSE Factor point is greater than the number of TRUE Factor point.


Finally, we saved the first scatterplot by running 
```{r save_scatterplot, message = FALSE}
# save the first scatterplot
ggsave("first_scatterplot.pdf", first_graph, height = 4, width = 6)
```
